    <h1 class="txt">6 Relationship Goals to Make Your Partnership Stronger</h1>
    <center><div class="card">
        <h3 class="card__title">1. Embrace imperfection
        </h3>
        <p class="card__content"></p>Of the relationship goals that are important to remember, but easy to forget, include that no relationship is perfect. You are not perfect, your partner is not perfect, you are both two imperfect people who love each other and have chosen to do life together. Fairy tales, movies, and social media often portray relationships as flawless, which can give the false impression that a healthy relationship is free of conflict. Try not to compare your relationship to anyone else’s — especially one that is made up for entertainment’s sake — and be more realistic with your own imperfections and those of your partner’s.

                <h3 class="card__title">2. Understand each other
                </h3>
                <p class="card__content">Everyone has different relationship goals and ways they like to express and receive love. That’s where learning your love language as a couple goal comes in. Developed by Gary Chapman, Ph.D, the five love languages consist of words of affirmation, quality time , receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch. In addition to the book The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate, there is a free test online to discover your love language. It can be helpful to understand your love language and your partner’s love language in order for the two of you to better understand and support each other and create smart goals for one another.</p></div>

                <h3 class="card__title">3. Align on core values and beliefs
                </h3>
                <p class="card__content">Central to your relationship goals should be to make sure you and your partner are aligned on your core values and beliefs. This is not a one and done conversation, but rather an ongoing conversation as your circumstances change and you evolve as both individuals and as a unit. For example, let’s say five years ago being able to pick up and move whenever you wanted was a core value for the two of you. But now you are craving stability and would like to settle down somewhere. It is important to make sure you talk to your partner about how your values might have shifted so you can decide how to move forward together.</p></div>

            <h3 class="card__title">4. Improve communication
            </h3>
            <p class="card__content">Everyone comes into a romantic relationship with a different upbringing, world view, strengths, and weaknesses. Don’t assume you know how your partner feels about a certain topic, ask them! Your shared smart goals should also include continually developing your communication skills with each other — critical to a strong relationship. Seeking support and relationship advice through in-person or online couples therapy can help you learn to understand each other better and improve your communication.</p></div>

            <h3 class="card__title">5. Create a judgement-free zone
            </h3>
            <p class="card__content">No one likes to be criticized, especially when you are sharing something difficult with your partner. Creating a judgement-free zone will help make sure your partner feels comfortable being open and honest with you. If you feel agitated and are not sure you will be able to withhold judgement, find a way to take a time out and resume the difficult conversation when you feel calmer. While having difficult conversations is never easy, it’s necessary as a couple goal if you want to grow your relationship in the long term.</p></div>

            <h3 class="card-title">6. Emotional management</h3><p class="card__content">Your partner is not a mind reader. It’s up to each individual to express their needs clearly to the other person. For example, if your partner said something that upset you, instead of giving them the silent treatment, blowing up, or name-calling, simply state: “That hurt my feelings.” A real relationship goal that can be very helpful is to focus on your own internal state and how what your partner did or said made you feel.</p>
